# Scholar Notes

**Scholar Notes** is a lightweight browser extension that allows researchers to attach personal notes to academic papers directly while browsing Google Scholar.

The goal is to keep literature exploration fast, focused, and distraction-free — without switching between multiple tools.

## 🎯 Motivation

As an academic researcher, I often found myself:
- reading papers on Google Scholar,
- taking short notes elsewhere,
- and losing context when switching tools.

**Scholar Notes** was created to solve this problem in the simplest possible way:
notes live exactly where the papers are.
